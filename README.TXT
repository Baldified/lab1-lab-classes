Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

   Pearson Education

It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.

************ ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ************

22. Q- Call the getName method on each object. Explain what is happening.     A- After calling getName on each object, a method result appears indicating the names of each object.

29. I added a picture of the terminal window for the finalized list in the files.

31. Q- What are the types of the following values?
       0 ----> int
       “hello” ----> string
       101 ----> int
       -1 ----> int
       true ----> boolean
       “33” ----> string
       3.1415 ----> int

32. Q- What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?      A- To add a new field to a circle object, you would have add a new private String to the source code.

35. Q- Look at the book you are reading now. Is it an object or a class?       A- It is a class because a book contains things. Basically, a book is like a container containing words and a number of pages further explaining why the book would be the class and the words and number of pages would be the objects.

36. Q- Can an object have several classes?       A- No, it cannot have more than one class because it is the class that holds the objects in its source code.
